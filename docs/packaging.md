# Notes to Package Maintainers

## Package Naming

The canonical executable name is "jpedit".
Assigning a "jpe" alias is recommended, if possible.

## ICU library name (SONAME)

This project optionally depends on the ICU library for its Search and Replace functionality.

By default, the project will look for the following library names:

 Variable | Windows | macOS | Linux / Other
----------|---------|-------|---------------
`EDIT_CFG_ICUUC_SONAME` | `icuuc.dll` | `libicucore.dylib` | `libicuuc.so`
`EDIT_CFG_ICUI18N_SONAME` | `icuin.dll` | `libicucore.dylib` | `libicui18n.so`

If your installation uses a different SONAME, please set the following environment variable at build time:
* `EDIT_CFG_ICUUC_SONAME`:
  For instance, `libicuuc.so.76`.
* `EDIT_CFG_ICUI18N_SONAME`:
  For instance, `libicui18n.so.76`.

Additionally, this project assumes that the ICU exports symbols without `_` prefix and without version suffix, such as `u_errorName`.
If your installation uses versioned exports, please set:
* `EDIT_CFG_ICU_CPP_EXPORTS`:
  If set to `true`, it'll look for C++ symbols such as `_u_errorName`.
  Enabled by default on macOS.
* `EDIT_CFG_ICU_RENAMING_VERSION`:
  If set to a version number, such as `76`, it'll look for symbols such as `u_errorName_76`.

Finally, you can set the following environment variables:
* `EDIT_CFG_ICU_RENAMING_AUTO_DETECT`:
  If set to `true`, the executable will try to detect the `EDIT_CFG_ICU_RENAMING_VERSION` value at runtime.
  The way it does this is not officially supported by ICU and as such is not recommended to be relied upon.
  Enabled by default on UNIX (excluding macOS) if no other options are set.

To test your build settings, run `cargo test` with the `--ignored` flag. For instance:
```sh
cargo test -- --ignored
```
