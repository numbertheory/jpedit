# Installation Guide

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/microsoft-edit.svg?exclude_unsupported=1)](https://repology.org/project/microsoft-edit/versions)

You can also download binaries from [our Releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/edit/releases/latest).

## Windows

You can install the latest version with WinGet:
```powershell
winget install Microsoft.Edit
```

## Linux (build from source)

If your distribution does not provide binaries, or if you'd like to build your own, you can use our install script, provided you have installed:
* Rust (via `rustup` or similar)
* A C compiler (e.g. `gcc`)
* ICU (e.g. libicu78, libicu, icu)
* curl/wget and tar

The following command will then install `msedit` into `~/.local/bin`:
```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/edit/main/assets/install.sh | sh
```

Additional flags are `--dev`, to build directly from the main branch, and `--system` to install into `/usr/local/bin`. For instance:
```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/edit/main/assets/install.sh | sh -s -- --dev --system
```

## macOS

You can install the latest version with Homebrew:
```sh
brew install msedit
```
